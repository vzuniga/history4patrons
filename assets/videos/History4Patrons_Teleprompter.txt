 Hello! This is a quick demo of History4Patrons — our patron reading history web

app.  Let’s walk through a few different scenarios so you can see how it works.

First, if a user tries to submit the form without entering a value, the app will

display an error message prompting them to enter one. This prevents empty values

from being sent and avoids unnecessary database errors.  Now, let’s say a user

enters something that looks like a valid patron number — it follows the correct

format — but the number itself isn’t valid. When they click submit, the app

checks against the database and returns an error message. The message will

advise the user to double-check the record number or confirm that the patron has

opted in to the Reading History feature.  This part is important: the app can

only retrieve reading history for patrons who have explicitly opted in. If they

haven’t, their history won’t be available.  Next, let’s enter a valid patron

record number.  We’ll paste it in, and then substitute the last digit with the

letter “A” to generate the check digit. As you can see, the format uses a 'p'

followed by the patron number and then ends with 'A'. This is a simplified way

to simulate the proper check digit.  Once we have that in place, we click

submit.  The app connects to the database, looks up the record number, and

retrieves the patron’s reading history.  If the query is successful, the app

prompts us to save the results. You’ll see a suggested filename — usually

including the patron record number — to help identify the file. But you can

rename it to anything you'd like.  Click “Save,” and now the file is stored

locally as a CSV.  Let’s open it in Excel.  Go to the Data tab, choose Import

from Text/CSV, and select the file we just saved.  Click Import, and now you’ll

see a clean, easy-to-read table with: - Title - Author - Item number (optional;

included mainly for staff use) - And the checkout date — which many of our

patrons specifically asked for.  We intentionally kept this file lean. Most

patrons don’t need extra details like call numbers or item types. But if needed,

we can always expand it to include additional fields. For now, this version

gives patrons exactly what they need — a clean, simple list of their past

checkouts.  Click Load, and just like that, the data is ready.  From here, you

can email the CSV file to the patron or use it however you like.  That wraps up

our demo of History4Patrons.  We hope you find it useful!  If you have any
